  abstract = {A fundamental requirement for the success of a manipulation task is the capability to handle the physical contact between a robot and the environment. Pure motion control turns out to be inadequate because the unavoidable modeling errors and uncertainties may cause a rise of the contact force, ultimately leading to an unstable behavior during the interaction, especially in the presence of rigid environments. Force feedback and force control becomes mandatory to achieve a robust and versatile behavior of a robotic system in poorly structured environments as well as safe and dependable operation in the presence of humans. This chapter starts from the analysis of indirect force control strategies, conceived to keep the contact forces limited by ensuring a suitable compliant behavior to the end effector, without requiring an accurate model of the environment. Then the problem of interaction tasks modeling is analyzed, considering both the case of a rigid environment and the case of a compliant environment. For the specification of an interaction task, natural constraints set by the task geometry and artificial constraints set by the control strategy are established, with respect to suitable task frames. This formulation is the essential premise to the synthesis of hybrid force/motion control schemes.},

  abstract = {In contexts where robots share their workspace with humans, safety is of utmost importance. Consequently, in recent years, a big impulse has been given to the design of human-friendly robots by involving both mechanical and control design aspects. Regarding controller design, this often involves introducing compliance and ensuring asymptotic stability using an interaction control scheme and passivity theory. Moreover, when human operators physically interact with the robot during work, strict safety measures become necessary with some of these including power and force limitations [1]. In this letter, a novel impedance control technique for collaborative robots is presented. The featured controller allows a safe human-robot interaction through energy and power limitations, assuring passivity through energy tanks. The proposed controller is evaluated with a KUKA LWR 4+ arm in a comanipulation environment.},

New use-case scenarios demand for collaborative robots, e.g. to assist the human with physically challenging tasks. These robots are mainly installed in work-environments with limited space, e.g. existing production lines. This brings certain challenges for the control of such robots. The presented work addresses a few of these challenges, namely: stable and safe behaviour in contact scenarios; avoidance of restricted workspace areas; prevention of joint limits in automatic mode and manual guidance.

In addition a new algorithm determines the grasp force according to the "slip" measured with the tactile sensor and the viscoelastic media on the fingertip.

For this purpose, Raibert and Craig have proposed the hybrid position/force control method. In this method, however, the manipulator dynamics has not been taken into account rigorously. The dynamic hybrid control method is proposed, which takes the manipulator dynamics into consideration. Constraints on the end effector are described by a set of constraint hypersurfaces. Then the basic equations for dynamic hybrid control are derived. It is shown that if the manipulator is not in a singular configuration, the desired position and force at the end effector can be simultaneously realized.

@article{Yoshikawa1991,
abstract = {Much research has been done recently on the analysis and design of multifingered robot hands. Several algorithms for determining the fingertip force for a given task have also been proposed. But, the grasping and manipulating forces involved in the manipulation of objects by robotic and human hands have not been defined in a physically reasonable way. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new definition of grasping and manipulating forces for multifingered robot hands. First, a short discussion of the grasping and manipulating forces for two-fingered hands with linear motion is given to explain the motivation more clearly and to give the basic idea of the new definition. Then, for three-fingered hands, based on a representation of the internal force, the grasping force is defined as an internal force that satisfies the static friction constraint. The concept of grasp mode is also introduced. The manipulating force is then defined as a fingertip force that satisfies the following three conditions: 1) It produces the specified resultant force. 2) It is not in the inverse direction of the grasping force. 3) It is orthogonal to the grasping force component. An algorithm for decomposing a given fingertip force into manipulating and grasping forces is presented. Extensions of the result to cases of two-fingered hands with planar motion and four-fingered hands are discussed. Finally, a simple example of synthesizing fingertip force for a given manipulation task is given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed definition. {\textcopyright} 1991 IEEE},

They first define initial grasping force as the force needed to hold a massless object. Then grasping force and contact normal during manipulation are determined from initial grasping force and initial contact normal by tracking the object displacement. Manipulation force, the finger force required to manipulate an object and to compensate for object weight, is computed by the generalized matrix inverse method. Optimal internal force, when necessary, is determined from the grasping force during manipulation without explicitly solving the optimization problem.

This method takes the manipulator dynamics and object dynamics into consideration and is for controlling the motion of the object as well as for controlling the constraint force and the internal force. The following results are obtained. (1) The force and kinematic relations are established for arms grasping and manipulating an object using various types of end effector. (2) Using the first result, a nonlinear state feedback law for the joint driving force that linearizes and decouples the robot system with respect to the object motion, constraint force, and internal force is given. A basic structure of the dynamic hybrid control system with a servo compensator is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been examined by a simple experiment. These results are useful for the fine manipulation of an object, in sense that one can specify the controller characteristics, such as the command response property and the robustness to modeling errors, uncertainties, and disturbances, independently for the individual specification of the object motion, the interaction between the object and its environment, and the grasping of the object.},

@article{Ajoudani2017,
abstract = {In humanoids and other redundant robots interacting with the environment, one can often choose between different configurations and control parameters to achieve a given task. A classic tool to describe specifications of the desired force/displacement behavior in such problems is the stiffness ellipsoid, whose geometry is affected by the choice of parameters in both joint control and redundancy resolution-namely, gains and angles. As is well known, impedance control techniques can regulate gains to realize any desired shape of the Cartesian stiffness ellipsoid at the end-effector, so that robot geometry selection could appear secondary. However, humans do not use this possibility: To control the stiffness of our arms, we predominantly use arm configurations. Why is that, and does it makes sense to do the same in robots? To understand this discrepancy, we provide a more complete analysis of the task-space force/deformation behavior of compliant redundant arms to illustrate why the arm geometry plays a dominant role in interaction capabilities of robots. We introduce the notion of allowable Cartesian force/displacement ("stiffness feasibility") regions (SFR) for compliant robots with given torque boundaries.We show that different robot configurations modify such regions and explore the role of robot geometry in achieving an appropriate SFR for the task at hand. The novel concepts and definitions are first illustrated in simulations. Experimental results are then provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed Cartesian force and stiffness control.},

abstract = {Coordination of multirobot systems has received extensive studies in the past decade. The majority of previous approaches require a complex setup of the hybrid position/force-control architecture, and have not fully addressed the coordination problem when the robots are not kinematically constrained but perform a common task. In this paper, we propose to use a new coordination scheme that is more straightforward and easier to implement and is applicable to a wider area. The basic idea of the new coordination strategy is to use the concept of motion synchronization, since the problem of coordinating multiple manipulators is basically the problem of maintaining certain kinematic relationships amongst robots. The key to the success of the new method is to ensure that each manipulator tracks its desired trajectory while synchronizing its motion with other manipulators' motions, so that differential (or synchronization) position errors amongst manipulators converge to zero. The controller, designed by incorporating the cross-coupling technology into an adaptive-control architecture, successfully guarantees asymptotic convergence to zero of both position tracking and synchronization errors simultaneously. Experiments and simulations on multirobot assembly systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

@article{Bonitz1996,
abstract = {An internal force-based impedance control scheme for cooperating manipulators is introduced which controls the motion of the objects being manipulated and the internal force on the objects. The controller enforces a relationship between the velocity of each manipulator and the internal force on the manipulated objects. Each manipulator is directly given the properties of an impedance by the controller; thus, eliminating the gain limitation inherent in the structure of previously proposed schemes. The controller uses the forces sensed at the robot end effectors to compensate for the effects of the objects' dynamics and to compute the internal force using only kinematic relationships. Thus, knowledge of the objects' dynamics is not required. Stability of the system is proven using Lyapunov theory and simulation results are presented validating the proposed concepts. The effect of computational delays in digital control implementations is analyzed vis-{\`{a}}-vis stability and a lower bound derived on the size of the desired manipulator inertia relative to the actual manipulator endpoint inertia. The bound is independent of the sample time. {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

@article{Erhart2015,
abstract = {The load distribution strategy in cooperative manipulation tasks allocates suitable force and torque setpoints to an ensemble of manipulators in order to implement a desired action on the manipulated object. Due to the manipulator redundancy, the load distribution computed by means of a generalized inverse of the grasp matrix is not uniquely determined. Controversial results on the nonsqueezing property of specific load distributions exist in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for the analysis of internal wrenches based on the kinematic constraints imposed to the manipulator ensemble. We unify previous results by showing that there exists no unique nonsqueezing load distribution and illustrate the consequences of our findings by means of several examples. In particular, the presented results provide a new perspective on the decomposition of interaction forces into internal and external components as required for cooperative multimanipulator control schemes.},

@article{Kido2010,
abstract = {Some operations such as transferring a heavy object require a Dual-Arm robot instead of a Single-Arm robot. Impedance control is good for controlling a robot interacting with the environment. Passivity is an important requirement for the safety of the people, environment and robots themselves. If the system does not satisfy passivity, high amount of energy has a chance of flowing from the robot to the environment. To prevent such accident, we control the coefficient of the desired velocity field according to the total energy of the system. We also limit the contact force between the object and the environment. In this paper, we propose a new passive control method for object transfer by Dual-Arm robot. Our new method assumes the following four conditions: (a)the system has two manipulators; (b)the controller is based on impedance control; (c)the system keeps passivity; (d)the trajectory of the object is designed with velocity field. Simulations of two robots with 3 D.O.F. holding an object interacting with an unknown stiff wall show that the system controlled with our new method satisfies passivity. Moreover, when the system is kept in a steady-state, we can obtain the relation equation between the energy of the system and the contact force. Computer simulations also validated the correctness of the relationship. {\textcopyright} 2010 SICE.},

abstract = {The authors present the dynamic control module of the Dynamic and Strategic Control of Cooperative Manipulators (DASCCOM) project at Stanford University's Aerospace Robotics Laboratory. First, the cooperative manipulation problem is analyzed from a systems perspective, and the desirable features of a control system for cooperative manipulation are discussed. Next, a control policy is developed that enforces a controlled impedance not of the individual arm endpoints, but of the manipulated object itself. A parallel implementation for a multiprocessor system is presented. The controller fully compensates for the system dynamics and directly controls the object internal forces. Most importantly, it presents a simple, powerful, intuitive interface to the strategic controller. Experimental results for a dual two-link arm robotic system are presented to verify the controllers performance, for both free-motion slews and environmental contact.},

@article{Dietrich2015,
abstract = {One step on the way to approach human performance in robotics is to provide joint torque sensing and control for better interaction capabilities with the environment, and a large number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs) for improved versatility. However, the increasing complexity also raises the question of how to resolve the kinematic redundancy which is a direct consequence of the large number of DOFs. Here we give an overview of the most practical and frequently used torque control solutions based on null space projections. Two fundamental structures of task hierarchies are reviewed and compared, namely the successive and the augmented method. Then the projector itself is investigated in terms of its consistency. We analyze static, dynamic, and the new concept of stiffness consistency. In the latter case, stiffness information is used in the pseudoinversion instead of the inertia matrix. In terms of dynamic consistency, we generalize the weighting matrix from the classical operational space approach and show that an infinite number of weighting matrices exist to obtain dynamic consistency. In this context we also analyze another dynamically consistent null space projector with slightly different structure and properties. The redundancy resolutions are finally compared in several simulations and experiments. A thorough discussion of the theoretical and empirical results completes this survey.},

@article{Lin2017,
abstract = {We propose a method for dual-arm manipulation of rigid objects, subject to external disturbance. The problem is formulated as a Cartesian impedance controller within a projected inverse dynamics framework. We use the constrained component of the controller to enforce contact and the unconstrained controller to accomplish the task with a desired 6-DOF impedance behaviour. Furthermore, the proposed method optimises the torque required to maintain contact, subject to unknown disturbances, and can do so without direct measurement of external force. The techniques are evaluated on a single-arm wiping a table and a dual-arm platform manipulating a rigid object of unknown mass and with human interaction. [1].},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel adaptive hybrid impedance control for a dual-arm robot is proposed to cooperatively manipulate unkown objects. This adaptive hybrid control scheme could be employed to improve motion tracking and internal force regulation performance when dual-arm cooperative robot grasping an unknown object. The controller has a master-slave structure, and we investigate the master-slave structure in three levels. The first level is an absolute-relative motion controller satifying the closed-chain constraints. The second level introduces an adaptive impedance control with variable stiffness to regulate the internal force. The motion and force control signals are fused in the third level by a select matrix. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, a dual-arm robotic system is set up with two UR5 arms and the experimental results illustrate the performance and feasibility of the proposed control strategy.},
